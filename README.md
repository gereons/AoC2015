From the commandline, use `swift run` or `swift run --configuration release`

From Xcode, simply hit `Cmd-R` to run. For this to work, you most likely have to change the path to the puzzle input files at the top of main.swift - on my machine, the files live in `$HOME/Developer/AdventOfCode/AoC2015/Fixtures/puzzle*.txt`
